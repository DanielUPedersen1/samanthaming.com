YAY!!! You did it! You learned all the properties of Flexbox! You're a Flexbox ninja now! We covered a lot in this short amount of time. Go back and re-visit the ones you still don't understand. Don't just read my Flexbox lessons. Check out other Flexbox tutorials. Sometimes reading a different perspective will help solidify your knowledge and fill in any gaps. Remember the best way to get better is to apply. I gave you the knowledge, now it's on YOU to apply and build something with it ðŸ’ª
