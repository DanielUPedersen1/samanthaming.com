Final tidbit! Let me give you one more tidbit for the road. Memorizing all the available properties is not easy. Even after doing creating this entire tutorial, I still don't have all these properties memorized. Being a good programmer is not about how much you memorize, it's about problem solving. And that's why it's important for a programmer to continue to stay humble and learn. It's all about expanding our toolkit so when we do face a problem, we have a variety of tools that we can select from to fix it ðŸ§°

Congratulation for completing Flexbox30! I hope you learned a lot and thank you for letting my tidbits be part of your programming journey ðŸ’›
