- [CLEAN] rename tidbit_scroll to tidibt_scroll_banner, same for blog

## Ready

- pictorials: add block code
- Flash message
- office hour page
- Fix "FIXME" items
- [IMPROVE] consider adding min-height on pages to solve the jump. The loading component height only solves when navigate programatically. For initial load (ssr), the jump will still happen.

## Next

- add rest of tidbits
- Implement https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog/
- remove min height
- Add left TOC for lesson page, try it
- remove loading? for SPA navigation?
- Change blog scroll to use flex, same as tidbit scroll

## Doing

- Make sure all nuxt-link and anchor has title
